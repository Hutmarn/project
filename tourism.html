    <h2>AYINKUNUGBA WATER FALLS</h2>
    <p>
        Ayikunugba waterfall is located in Oke-IlaOrangun, Ifedayo Local government Area. The water fall is in the thick forest and it is the opposite of Olumirin waterfalls where you climb to appreciate its view, but in Ayikunugba waterfalls, tourists will descend to discover the wonderful work of nature within the beautiful landscape of mountains, caves and trees.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Waterfall was discovered by a hunter (Pa Adeogun) during a hunting expedition. He shot a strange animal called 'Nugba' which rolled down and stumbled into the water falls. The site, besides being tourists' attraction is also recommended as a place to keep fit by exercising in the course of descending and ascending the water falls

    <h2>OGEDENGBE'S SEAT</h2>
    <p>
        Ogedengbe was a military general who fought actively in the Yoruba Civil Wars. The fighting went on for about nine years. Leaders of the Ijeshas and the Ekitis had to persuade Ogedengbe to come and lead them as his unrivaled exploits had become a legend in the whole of Yoruba land. He agreed and went to the battle field to check the inordinate ambition of the Ibadan people. It was Captain Bower, the then resident commissioner at Ibadan who finally settled the war by a treaty in 1886 (23rd September, 1886) after he had won the war.

    <h2>SITE OF THE KIRJI PEACE TREATY</h2>
    <p>
        The Yoruba Kiriji Wars was an epic and chronic civil war between two powerful Yoruba confederate armies of mainly Western Yorubas (Ibadan and its allies) and Eastern Yorubas (Ijeshas and Ekitis). It is on record that the remote cause of this war was the collapse of the Oyo empire, while the immediate cause was the domineering stance of the Ibadan military output on Yoruba towns and cities. It is said that the war lasted for about 16 years with heavy casualties on both sides although historians believe that the losses were even. Also, the war showcased the largest array of military hardwares in Western Africa. It is said that the Eastern Yoruba confederacy purchased a large number of cannon guns which produced the thunderous sound "Kiriiiiji". The name "Kiriji" came from the earth-like vibrations that accompanied the use of the cannons and it indeed gave the Eastern Yorubas an advantage over the Ibadans. Meanwhile, it is believed that several Yoruba towns and villages were completely wiped out of history due to the scorched-earth policy of the civil war. Two good examples of such settlements are Osogun (somewhere in Oyo) and Ijaiye. Imesi ile houses the relics of kiriji war and the cenotaph of the 12 peace treaty article signed on the 23rd of September 1886, by the Governor of Lagos State with his Commissioners Henry Ingis and Oliver Smith alongside his interpreter Rev. Johnson (the first writer of the Yoruba history) from Oyo lle. The Iwo cenotaphs mark the signing of the treaty between Ibadan and Ekiti parapo at the time when all the Yoruba land was under the Lagos colony. An event annually celebrated on the 23rd of September.
